We presented two algorithms for dynamic computation of PageRanks in an evolving graph. We observed that \levelwisePR{} algorithm is a suitable approach for CPUs. However on a GPU, smaller levels/components could be combined and processed at a time in order to help improve GPU usage efficiency as \monolithicPR suggests.

We make the following additional observations about our paper. We assumed that the SCCs of the graph do not change due to the batch of updates. If the SCCs change due to the batch of updates, we can apply our algorithms after the obtaining the new SCCs. Further, it is relatively easy to extend our ideas to the case where vertices are inserted/deleted in addition to edges. The links to source code, along with data sheets and charts, for both the experiments \cite{gh-levl21} is included in references.
